### **Recommendation Engine Design Plan**

#### **Objective**
The objective is to design a recommendation engine that matches organizations with grant-offering organizations based on relevance and needs. This involves leveraging the data scraped from the earlier web scraping exercise, selecting appropriate models/algorithms, and implementing strategies to ensure the recommendation engine remains effective and improves over time.

### **1. Data Preprocessing and Utilization**

#### **Preprocessing Steps**

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Ensure no duplicate grant records are present. If duplicates are needed categorize them.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Impute missing data or discard records with incomplete information, depending on the significance of the missing data.
   - **Normalize Text Data**: Convert all text data to lowercase, remove special characters, and apply stemming/lemmatization to standardize the text fields.

2. **Data Enrichment**:
   - **Categorization**: Categorize grants based on the type of organization (e.g., non-profit, educational, research, etc.) and the type of grant (e.g., technology, education, healthcare).
   - **Feature Extraction**: Extract features such as organization size, geographical location, grant amount, deadlines, and eligibility criteria. Use NLP techniques like TF-IDF to extract features from textual descriptions.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Vectorization**: Convert categorical data into numerical form using one-hot encoding or embedding techniques. For textual data, use vectorization techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or sentence embeddings (BERT).
   - **Scaling**: Normalize numerical features like grant amount, organization size, etc., to ensure uniformity in the feature space.

#### **Data Utilization**

- **Matching Criteria**: Use the preprocessed data to define matching criteria between organizations and grants. Key factors include the type of organization, grant type, eligibility criteria, geographical location, and past grant success rates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create composite features that can enhance matching accuracy, such as the “fit score” between an organization’s mission and a grant’s purpose, or the probability of successful grant acquisition based on historical data.

### **2. Model/Algorithm Selection**

#### **Model Selection**

1. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   - **Why**: Content-based filtering is ideal for situations where we have detailed information about both the grants and the organizations. It works well with the features extracted from the scraped data, such as grant descriptions, eligibility criteria, and organizational needs.
   - **Implementation**: The recommendation is based on the similarity between the content of the grants and the needs of the organization. Cosine similarity or Euclidean distance metrics can be used to compare the vectors representing the organizations and the grants.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - **Why**: Collaborative filtering (especially Matrix Factorization methods like Singular Value Decomposition, SVD) is beneficial when we have user feedback or interaction data (e.g., previous grant applications or successes). It predicts the preferences of an organization based on the preferences of similar organizations.
   - **Implementation**: Use implicit feedback (e.g., grants an organization has viewed or applied for) to build a user-item matrix. Factorization techniques can then be applied to predict the relevance of new grants to the organization.

3. **Hybrid Models**:
   - **Why**: Combining content-based filtering and collaborative filtering leverages the strengths of both approaches. This hybrid approach can provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.
   - **Implementation**: A weighted average of the predictions from both content-based and collaborative filtering models can be used, with the weight dynamically adjusted based on the availability and quality of data.

### **3. Measuring Success of the Recommendations**

#### **Key Metrics**

1. **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**:
   - Measures the ratio of users who click on a recommended grant to the number of users who see the recommendation. A higher CTR indicates that the recommendations are relevant to the users.

2. **Conversion Rate**:
   - Measures the ratio of users who apply for a grant after clicking on the recommendation. This metric directly reflects the effectiveness of the recommendations.

3. **Precision and Recall**:
   - **Precision**: Measures the proportion of relevant recommendations among the total recommendations made.
   - **Recall**: Measures the proportion of relevant recommendations that were successfully identified out of all possible relevant recommendations.

4. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**:
   - Measures the rank of the first relevant recommendation. A higher MRR indicates that relevant grants are ranked higher in the recommendation list.

5. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect qualitative feedback from users on the relevance of the recommendations to improve the model over time.

### **4. Optimizing Recommendations Over Time**

#### **Strategies for Optimization**

1. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Continuously collect feedback from users on the relevance of the recommendations. Use this feedback to retrain and fine-tune the model, allowing it to adapt to changing user preferences.

2. **Incremental Learning**:
   - Implement online learning algorithms that update the model incrementally as new data arrives, rather than retraining the model from scratch.

3. **A/B Testing**:
   - Regularly conduct A/B tests to compare the performance of different recommendation algorithms or variations of the current model. Use the results to iteratively improve the recommendation engine.

4. **Personalization**:
   - Introduce more granular personalization over time by incorporating additional user-specific data (e.g., user’s history, preferences) and using more sophisticated models like deep learning-based collaborative filtering or neural collaborative filtering.

### **5. Managing Recommendations for New Clients**

#### **Cold Start Problem**

1. **Cold Start for New Clients**:
   - **Solution**: Use content-based filtering as it does not require historical interaction data. The initial recommendations are based solely on the content similarity between the organization’s profile and the available grants.
   - **Onboarding Survey**: Collect additional information during the onboarding process to better understand the new client’s needs and preferences. This data can be used to bootstrap the recommendation process.

2. **Cold Start for New Grants**:
   - **Solution**: Use the metadata and content of the new grant to match it with organizations that have similar profiles or interests. The recommendation engine can initially rely on content-based filtering until sufficient interaction data is collected.

### **6. Pseudo Code for Core Functionality**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Function to calculate content-based similarity between organizations and grants
def calculate_similarity(organization_profile, grant_profiles):
    """
    Calculates cosine similarity between an organization's profile and a list of grant profiles.
    
    Args:
        organization_profile (ndarray): Feature vector representing the organization.
        grant_profiles (ndarray): Matrix where each row is a feature vector representing a grant.
    
    Returns:
        ndarray: Array of similarity scores.
    """
    similarities = cosine_similarity(organization_profile.reshape(1, -1), grant_profiles)
    return similarities.flatten()

# Function to recommend top grants for an organization
def recommend_grants(organization_profile, grant_profiles, grant_ids, top_n=5):
    """
    Recommends top N grants for an organization based on content-based similarity.
    
    Args:
        organization_profile (ndarray): Feature vector representing the organization.
        grant_profiles (ndarray): Matrix where each row is a feature vector representing a grant.
        grant_ids (list): List of grant IDs corresponding to the grant profiles.
        top_n (int): Number of top recommendations to return.
    
    Returns:
        list: List of recommended grant IDs.
    """
    similarities = calculate_similarity(organization_profile, grant_profiles)
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_n:][::-1]
    recommended_grants = [grant_ids[i] for i in top_indices]
    return recommended_grants

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example organization profile (vectorized features)
    organization_profile = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3])

    # Example grant profiles (matrix of vectorized features)
    grant_profiles = np.array([
        [0.2, 0.1, 0.6, 0.3],
        [0.5, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4],
        [0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.1],
        [0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6]
    ])

    # Corresponding grant IDs
    grant_ids = ['grant1', 'grant2', 'grant3', 'grant4']

    # Get top 2 recommendations
    top_recommendations = recommend_grants(organization_profile, grant_profiles, grant_ids, top_n=2)
    print(f"Top Recommendations: {top_recommendations}")
```

### **Conclusion**

The proposed recommendation engine leverages both content-based and collaborative filtering methods to match organizations with relevant grants. By preprocessing the scraped data effectively and using the right algorithms, the engine can provide personalized and accurate recommendations. The success of the recommendations will be measured using various metrics such as CTR, conversion rate, and user feedback. Over time, the recommendation engine will be optimized through continuous learning, user feedback, and A/B testing, ensuring it remains effective and granular in its recommendations. The pseudo code provides a foundational approach to implementing the core functionality of the recommendation engine.
