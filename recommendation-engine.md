Recommendation Engine Design Plan
Objective
The objective is to design a recommendation engine that matches organizations with grant-offering organizations based on relevance and needs. This involves leveraging the data scraped from the earlier web scraping exercise, selecting appropriate models/algorithms, and implementing strategies to ensure the recommendation engine remains effective and improves over time.

1. Data Preprocessing and Utilization
Preprocessing Steps
Data Cleaning:

Remove Duplicates: Ensure no duplicate grant records are present.
Handle Missing Values: Impute missing data or discard records with incomplete information, depending on the significance of the missing data.
Normalize Text Data: Convert all text data to lowercase, remove special characters, and apply stemming/lemmatization to standardize the text fields.
Data Enrichment:

Categorization: Categorize grants based on the type of organization (e.g., non-profit, educational, research, etc.) and the type of grant (e.g., technology, education, healthcare).
Feature Extraction: Extract features such as organization size, geographical location, grant amount, deadlines, and eligibility criteria. Use NLP techniques like TF-IDF to extract features from textual descriptions.
Data Transformation:

Vectorization: Convert categorical data into numerical form using one-hot encoding or embedding techniques. For textual data, use vectorization techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or sentence embeddings (BERT).
Scaling: Normalize numerical features like grant amount, organization size, etc., to ensure uniformity in the feature space.
Data Utilization
Matching Criteria: Use the preprocessed data to define matching criteria between organizations and grants. Key factors include the type of organization, grant type, eligibility criteria, geographical location, and past grant success rates.
Feature Engineering: Create composite features that can enhance matching accuracy, such as the “fit score” between an organization’s mission and a grant’s purpose, or the probability of successful grant acquisition based on historical data.
